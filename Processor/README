============== README ====================

There are 3 relevant Verilog files created for the processor part of this project: cpu.v, mem.v, core.v

There are also a number of simple test cases designed to show very simple features of our processor; these were used as we were developing and testing functionality of the processor and are a good way to understand the basics. 
	To compile: make
	To run: make test
	To clean: make clean
	(the exact same format as p9)

The tests have names that describe exactly what they are doing, and I included the test case t0.hex and my own vgorti.hex from p9, to show backwards compatability with what we already did.
